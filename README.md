# Terraform

Terraform is an Orchestration Tool, that is part of infrastructure as code.

Where Chef and Packer sit more on the Configuration management side and create immutable AMIs.

Terraform sits on the orchestrates side. This includes the creation of networks and complex systems and deploys AMIs.

An AMI is a blueprint (snap shot) of an instance:
- The operating system
- data and storage
- all the packages and exact state of a machine when AMI was created
